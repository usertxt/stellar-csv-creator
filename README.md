### Stellar CSV Creator
This app fetches transactions from the Stellar network and automatically adds them to a CSV file for easy 
tracking purposes.

Insert your Stellar address into the address field, then put in the date of the oldest transaction you would 
like to receive, then press the Create CSV button. Use the End Date field for a specific date range.

Use the Settings tab to change the settings to fit your needs. The CSV's **Source** and **Memo** fields can 
be configured. Use the **Minimum Threshold** and **Maximum Threshold** to target your typical inflation 
transactions. For example, if you usually receive an inflation payment of around 8.3535963 XLM, then set your 
Minimum Threshold to 8 and your Maximum Threshold to 8.6. Give yourself some room on either side of the 
threshold as inflation payments tend to go up and down.
